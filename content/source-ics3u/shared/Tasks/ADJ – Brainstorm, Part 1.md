## Introduction

As we move through this course, you will begin to think about apps you might like to write, and then narrow down your ideas to the one that is most interesting to you and useful to others.

That is the purpose of your ADJ, or *App Design Journal*.

You will move through the four stages:

1. Brainstorm
2. Plan
3. Prototype
4. Evaluate

... understanding that design is sometimes, and perhaps often, a messy process.

As described in our course outline, design is an iterative process, so each step can be revisited as needed:

Today, you will begin the process of brainstorming by getting inspired by the design journey of other app developers, and starting to identify apps that you have used, and why you like them.

To do this, please create an entry in your portfolio [on Notion](https://notion.so), using the **ADJ: Brainstorm, Part 1** template:

Once you have created that entry, please read through the introduction, follow some of the links, and then add your thoughts in the spaces indicated.
