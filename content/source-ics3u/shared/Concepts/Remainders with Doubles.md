## Mr. Gordon's query

This page describes how theÂ `remainder(dividingBy:)`Â instance method of theÂ `Double`Â data type in Swift rounds off values:

[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/double/remainder(dividingby:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/double/remainder(dividingby:))

It implements remainder operation as defined by the [IEEE 754 specification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4610935).

Can you please summarize how remainders are calculated, using language that would be easily understood by a high school student that is just starting to learn about programming?

In particular, please include examples that explain why this code:

```swift
let remainder = Double(16.5).remainder(dividingBy: 2.5)
```

... results inÂ `remainder`Â having a value of `-1`, whereas this code:

```swift
let otherRemainder = Double(13.5).remainder(dividingBy: 2.5)
```

... results inÂ `otherRemainder`Â having a value of `1`.

## ChatGPT's response

Sure! Letâ€™s break it down in a way thatâ€™s easy to follow.

In Swift, theÂ `remainder(dividingBy:)`Â method works a little differently from the regular modulo operation you may have seen before. This method follows theÂ **IEEE 754 specification**, which means the remainder it returns isnâ€™t just whatâ€™s left after dividing two numbersâ€”it also considersÂ **which result is closer to 0 on the number line**. This is why sometimes the remainder can beÂ **negative**. Letâ€™s walk through the examples you mentioned.

### HowÂ `remainder(dividingBy:)`Â Works

When you divide two numbers usingÂ `remainder(dividingBy:)`, Swift:

1. Divides the first number (called theÂ **dividend**) by the second number (called theÂ **divisor**).
2. Rounds theÂ **quotient**Â (the result of the division) to theÂ **nearest whole number**.
3. Uses this rounded quotient to figure out what part is left over, or theÂ **remainder**.

**If the quotient is exactly halfway between two numbers, it rounds to the nearest even number**Â (this is calledÂ _rounding to even_Â orÂ _bankers' rounding_).

---

#### Example 1

```swift
let remainder = Double(16.5).remainder(dividingBy: 2.5)
```

1. **Dividend**: 16.5
2. **Divisor**: 2.5
3. **Exact Quotient**: 16.5 Ã· 2.5 = 6.6  
    (The quotient is between 6 and 7.)

Since 6.6 is closer toÂ **7**, we round the quotient toÂ **7**.

4. **Rebuilding the result**:  
    $$7Ã—2.5=17.5$$
    <br/>But the original number was 16.5, so the remainder is:  
    $$16.5âˆ’17.5=âˆ’1$$

**Answer:**Â The remainder isÂ **-1**.

---

#### Example 2

```swift
let otherRemainder = Double(13.5).remainder(dividingBy: 2.5)
```

1. **Dividend**: 13.5
2. **Divisor**: 2.5
3. **Exact Quotient**: 13.5 Ã· 2.5 = 5.4  
    (The quotient is between 5 and 6.)

Since 5.4 is closer toÂ **5**, we round the quotient toÂ **5**.

4. **Rebuilding the result**:  
    $$5Ã—2.5=12.5$$
    <br/>The original number was 13.5, so the remainder is:  
    $$13.5âˆ’12.5=1$$

**Answer:**Â The remainder isÂ **1**.

---

### Why Are the Remainders Different?

The key reason is thatÂ **`remainder(dividingBy:)`Â rounds the quotient to the nearest whole number**, and depending on whether that number is higher or lower, the remainder can flip betweenÂ **positive or negative**.

- In the first example, rounding gave us 7, which resulted in a remainder of -1.
- In the second example, rounding gave us 5, which resulted in a remainder of 1.

### A Simple Rule of Thumb forÂ `remainder(dividingBy:)`

- It tries to find the remainder thatâ€™s closest toÂ **0**Â on the number line.
- If the quotient is exactly halfway between two numbers, it rounds to the nearest even number, which can affect whether the remainder is positive or negative.

I hope this makes things clearer! Let me know if you have any questions or if anything is still confusing.

## Mr. Gordon's followup question

OK, that's easy enough to understand.

Can you elaborate on why the IEEE 754 defines the remainder operation in this way?

How is that approach to describing the remainder more useful than simply saying that, for example, the remainder when 18.0 divided by 5.0 is 3.0?

## ChatGPT's response

Great question! Letâ€™s dive intoÂ **why**Â the IEEE 754 specification defines the remainder operation the way it does and why it's useful in certain contexts, especially for computers and math-heavy calculations.

### The Reason for the IEEE 754 Approach

IEEE 754 is a standard for how computers handleÂ **floating-point numbers**, which are numbers with decimals. The key goals of this standard are to ensure:

- **Precision**: So that small rounding errors donâ€™t add up over time.
- **Consistency**: So that different computers and software get the same results when doing math.

The IEEE 754 remainder operation is designed with these goals in mind. Hereâ€™s why it does things a little differently than the simpler modulo operation (like you mentioned, where 18.0 Ã· 5.0 gives a remainder of 3.0):

1. **Round to the Nearest Quotient for Accuracy**: The IEEE 754 remainder operation rounds the quotient to theÂ **nearest integer**Â to give a remainder that isÂ **as close to 0 as possible**. This approach helps reduce errors, especially in scientific and engineering applications where very small differences can have a big impact.
    
    For example:
    
    - If you divide 16.5 by 2.5, getting a remainder of -1 is actually a smaller difference (closer to 0) than 1.5, which is what youâ€™d get from the standard modulo operation.
    
    This is moreÂ **accurate**Â when working with numbers that represent real-world measurements, where precision is key.
    
2. **Positive or Negative Remainders**: The remainder can be positive or negative because the idea is to find theÂ **shortest distance**Â to zero. This is different from the modulo operation, where the remainder is always positive.
    
    Imagine a number line where you're looking for the closest "multiple" of your divisor:
    
    - For 16.5 Ã· 2.5, the closest multiple of 2.5 is 17.5, so the remainder is -1.
    - For 13.5 Ã· 2.5, the closest multiple is 12.5, so the remainder is 1.
    
    This allows the operation to "flip directions" when needed, making it more suitable forÂ **circular calculations**, like angles or trigonometry (e.g., thinking about wrapping around a circle where sometimes you need a negative remainder to go backward).

### Why Not Just Use Simple Modulo?

The simple modulo operation works well when you're just interested inÂ **splitting things evenly**Â and donâ€™t care about precision beyond whole numbers. For example, if you're dividing pizza slices or handling file sizes.

However, the IEEE 754 remainder approach is useful in situations where:

1. **Precision Matters**: In scientific computing, finance, and engineering, small differences in rounding can lead to significant errors over many calculations. The IEEE method minimizes those errors.
    
2. **Symmetry in Math**: When doing math that involves symmetry, like trigonometric functions (sine, cosine), physics simulations, or graphics programming, itâ€™s important to have remainders that areÂ **evenly distributed**Â and as close to zero as possible, even if that means having negative remainders.
    
3. **Circular Calculations**: If youâ€™re working with angles (think of rotating objects in a video game or doing GPS calculations), the IEEE remainder makes sense because the shortest path back to a reference point could be positive or negative, depending on which way youâ€™re rotating.

### Example: Angle Calculations

Imagine youâ€™re working with angles. Suppose you want to find out how far a given angle is from a full 360Â° rotation:

- UsingÂ **modulo**, if you divide 370Â° by 360Â°, you get a remainder of 10Â°, which is correct for a positive angle.
- But withÂ **IEEE remainder**, if your angle was something like -370Â°, it would give you a remainder of -10Â°, meaning youâ€™re 10Â° away but in the negative direction (counter-clockwise). This might be the direction you need to rotate in some cases.

This negative remainder can be more useful in calculations involving circular motion, physics simulations, or any scenario where direction matters.

---

### In Short:

- **IEEE 754 remainder**Â is more precise because it minimizes rounding errors.
- It provides a remainder thatâ€™sÂ **closest to zero**Â on the number line, which can be positive or negative.
- This is more useful in certain math-heavy fields, like physics, graphics, or finance, where precision and symmetry are important, and rounding errors can add up over time.
